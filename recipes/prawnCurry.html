        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple recipe is quick and requires only a handful of ingredients, most of which you probably have to hand!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>A large knob of butter</li>

            <li>5 or 6 cloves of garlic, diced</li>
            <li>A thumb-sized piece of ginger, diced</li>
            <li>1 thinly chopped green chilli</li>
            <li>4 tomatoes, core removed and cut into eighths</li>
            <li>Half a level teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>One heaped teaspoon of turmeric</li>
            <li>A generous pinch of cumin seeds</li>
            <li>3/4 level teaspoon of paprika</li>
            <li>Half a level teaspoon of crushed black pepper</li>
            <li>Half a level teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
            <li>400 grams of prawns</li>
            <li>A handful of coriander, roughly chopped (and a generous pinch for garnishing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add the olive oil, butter, onion, garlic and ginger to the pan on a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once they start to turn golden brown, add the chilli and spices, stirring regularly to ensure the mixture does't burn.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, add the prawns and turn the heat up so they cook well. Stir regularly to ensure the mixture is cooked evenly.</li>
            <li>After 4 or 5 minutes, add the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Stir regularly every 3 or 4 minutes, using your cooking spoon to pur√©e the the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Cook for 20 - 25 minutes, until enough water has evaporated so the mixture becomes a thick sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped coriander and stir through.</li>
            <li>Serve into a bowl and garnish with some whole coriander leaves.</li>
