        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This nourishing dish requires little effort, and tastes great on cold winter evenings.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One large mug of red lentils</li>
            <li>Enough olive oil to generously cover a small pan</li>
            <li>Six cloves of garlic, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>A thumb sized piece of ginger, roughly chopeed</li>
            <li>Three green chillis, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>A generous pinch of cumin seeds</li>
            <li>One generous teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>One heaped teaspoon of turmeric</li>
            <li>One level teaspoon of chilli powder</li>
            <li>A pinch of paprika</li>
            <li>A handful of coriander, roughly chopped (and a generous pinch for garnishing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the lentils to the pan and add enough boiling water so that it's covered by a few inches</li>
                <li>Add the spices, but not the cumin seeds, and stir the mixture every 5 minutes</li>
                <li>In a smaller pan, add the olive oil, the garlic and ginger.</li>
                <li>Fry until they turn light brown, then add the cumin seeds and green chillis</li>
                <li>When this mixture turns golden brown, turn the heat off.</li>
                <li>It will take 45 minutes - 1 hour for the lentils to become cooked well enough</li>
                <li>If you would like a thinner daal, add boiling water.</li>
                <li>Once you're satisfied with the consistency, add the fried mixture and stir through.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped coriander and stir through.</li>
                <li>Serve into a bowl and garnish with some whole coriander leaves.</li>
            </ol>
